4. Allow user to select output format
5. Quality slider (1–100%) with visible percentage
6. Show final output file size in KB after conversion
7. Smart compression mode:
   - User enters target file size (KB)
   - Automatically find best quality using binary search
   - Never exceed target size
8. Watermark support:
   - Text watermark (bottom-right)
   - Adjustable opacity
9. Before / After image preview
10. Remove image option before processing
11. Mobile-friendly responsive UI
